## 🔧 Technical Details

### When Does the Bot Respond?
The bot only responds to:
- Messages containing commands (help, suggest gift, etc.)
- Messages mentioning "Santa"
- Specific holiday-related keywords

### When Does It Stay Quiet?
- Regular group conversation
- Personal messages between users
- Non-command messages

This way, the bot enhances the chat without being intrusive!
